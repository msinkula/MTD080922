      <p class="logo-text">&ldquo;The Business Improvement Program is about personal awareness, personal development, and understanding the impact we have on others. Because for any of us, we have intent, but achieving that intent is based on far more than wanting it: you’ve got to know the impact you’re going to have on other people. What I’m really getting out of Merriweather has been tremendous growth.&rdquo;</p>

        <p class="logo-text">&ldquo;The 'before-and-after' we got with the Merriweather program has been incredible. Our team creates consistent applications for customers across the globe.  Assembling a single team from a range of disparate teams scattered across the globe was a challenge and we engaged Merriweather to help build the team into a high performance team able to meet customer demands on time and on budget. Merriweather’s Business Improvement Program transformed this team to the point where it now excels at rapid delivery of applications and regularly exceeds client expectations. It’s engaged and performing at levels never before seen.&rdquo;</p>

       <p>As the head of a department or organization, all eyes are on you to deliver results. With the increasing demand on business leaders to justify project investments, it’s critical the leader chooses the right projects and ensures they’re run well. An organization needs to know they are making the best use of internal and vendor resources, so that projects are delivered efficiently without delays or cost overruns. Yet without the right processes and guidelines in place, people are working ad hoc, managing too many projects with varying degrees of success. The reality is that nearly 70 percent of projects fail due to either a lack of project management methodologies or improper implementation of them.</p>

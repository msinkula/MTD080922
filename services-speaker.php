        <p>At Merriweather, we turn presenters into exceptional speakers. We eliminate the fear factors from speaking and push an individual out of their comfort zone in a ‘safe’ environment, helping to challenge and stretch abilities to become a better speaker. The Merriweather Inspirational Speaker Training program can help an individual become a more effective and influential speaker. We help focus on the audience’s needs and find a persons “authentic voice” for maximum impact. We provide the tools, techniques, and most importantly, the practical experience, to create a confident and compelling speaker.</p>
        <p>The Inspirational Speaker Training program is designed to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Teach presenters to speak from the heart</li>
        <li>Identify the true audience</li>
        <li>Connect with the audience in a genuine and conversational manner</li>
        <li>Help an individual to enjoy speaking in front of people</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you’re in a hurry to improve speaking skills with the team, then this program is designed for you. In just two days, presenters of every level can benefit tremendously and improve their skills. From beginners hesitant to take center stage to accomplished executives looking to better connect with audiences and polish their delivery.</p>
        <h3>2-Day Intensive “Boot Camp” Format</h3>
        <p>We call it a boot camp for a very good reason. We’ve compressed into
          an intensive 2-day workshop more information and speaking practice
          than you’d get in a year at a speaker’s
          club. This interactive program provides the basic training to become
          an inspirational speaker. No boring lectures here. Each day is a highly-interactive
          session, and within the first hour, participants will be on their feet
        in front of a camera giving a 3-minute presentation.</p>
      <p>Throughout the training program, there is lots of hands-on experience delivering, an average of 9 to 12 presentations. Working groups tend to be small around five or six in each with a dedicated coach/instructor. This format creates a safe environment for everyone, and allows us to follow each presentation with candid feedback and support from coaches.</p>
        <h3>Two Courses in One</h3>
        <p>The Inspirational Speaker Training program is really two programs in one. Our program curriculum is modelled around leadership, because we believe that like any successful leader, a speaker’s purpose is to convince, influence and effect change. We provide the leadership tools and accelerated learning techniques that will help an individual become an inspirational speaker. These same tools and techniques can be taken back to the workplace to help teams achieve exceptional performance levels.</p>

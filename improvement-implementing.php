        <p>The core of the program&rsquo;s content at each level is the delivery
        of our client&rsquo;s business goals.  Therefore team’s leave each phase
        of their BIP meetings knowing they have delivered more of the ‘day job’  &mdash;
        not with more to do and less time to do it in. These tailored programs
        are designed to compliment existing meetings and not add additional meeting
        time. The Business Improvement Programs make best use of available time
        through highly effective and exciting meetings with a focus on collective
        results, facilitated by accomplished Merriweather business coaches.</p>
      <p>The three levels of programs are segmented to allow for the strategic versus the tactical demands on each level of the organisation and are typically delivered over a twelve month period.</p>
        <p>We know from research that on average 25% of an employee’s time is
          wasted due to a lack of clarity. Therefore, the Merriweather methodology
          provides an expedient way for clarity to permeate 
          from the top of the organization to the grass roots. We do this using
          a cascade approach. Merriweather begins working with the leader and
          their leadership team. The management teams then bring their teams
          together. It is the sequence and frequency of the meetings which enables
          a cascade of the critical information downwards and solutions to flow
          upwards &mdash; whilst
          achieving absolute clarity of the business goals and developing more
          exemplary leadership &mdash; an inspired team!</p>

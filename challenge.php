        <p>The challenges of leadership are not diminishing. Research reports that current corporate policies, laws, expectations and technology are making it even harder for leaders to enjoy successfully leading teams &mdash; before we consider the implications of current market conditions!!</p>
        <p><b>Why is leadership often so hard? What is it we really want and need? What would enable us to enjoy our incredibly demanding role of leadership more? How can we lead teams to success more easily and consistently?</b></p>
        <p>Merriweather has an outstanding track record of success in working with leaders and teams all around the world</p>
        <p>Merriweather helps clients achieve their quest for outstanding results and to enjoy doing so by guiding them to focus on their approach to achieving outstanding results.</p>
        <p>Our clients come to enjoy the business benefits of having a team who are clear on where they are going and have an understanding of what may be required to get there, a team where everyone is accountable and committed to becoming a more exemplary leader themselves. A team where conversations are ‘Business’ and not ‘Personal’, a team where absolute clarity enables the right people to resolve the right issues with a common understanding, approach and ‘language’. A team where people know what they do not have to do.</p>
        <p>Our clients enjoy the business benefits of leading a team who have taken the time to agree and develop the right culture to thrive in and enjoy working together to overcome the normal corporate dysfunctions. A team where everyone can enjoy the business benefits of having exciting and effective meetings, a place where they can enjoy developing as a leader with less frustration, stress and wasted time and energy. A place where leadership is rewarding and fulfilling. </p>
        <p>Our clients learn to enjoy the business benefits of leading a successful
          team which everyone wants to join and no one wants to leave. Teams
          where on target quarterly results are the norm, efficiencies
          are embraced and solutions to their business challenges are found from
          within the team.</p>
        <p>This is what Merriweather calls an ‘inspired team’. Merriweather can
        help you get one through the Merriweather Business Improvement Program.</p>
